# ViewManager for Corona SDK

This is an attempt to create a simple view manager class for corona sdk projects. The goal is to keep it simple and light. basically swapping out one view for another and adding some simple transition effects.


## About the project

This project was started for my own personal use but please feel free too fork and add. I would like to add some other classes for doing stuff like modal or popup windows.
